You are about to receive the contents of several files that together make up a codebase. After each file's content is provided, please respond with "learned." When you see the phrase "(last-file)" at the beginning of a file, it indicates that it is the final file. Once you have learned the contents of the final file, please provide a list of options for further actions.

The list of options should include the following items (you can add more items based on what you have learned):

Refactor the code
Summarize the code
Optimize performance
Identify potential bugs
Suggest better naming conventions
Provide additional error handling
Suggest additional features
Please wait for the content of each file to be pasted before responding. Remember to only respond with "learned" after each file is pasted, and provide the list of options after learning the contents of the final file marked with "(last-file)".
